class MyClass {
    public static void main(String[ ] args) {
        System.out.println("Rana");//print new line in end of string 
    System.out.print("Abobakar");//not print new line

    }

/*In Java, every line of code that can actually run needs to be inside a class.
In our example, we named the class MyClass. You will learn more about classes in the upcoming modules.

In Java, each application has an entry point, or a starting point, which is a method called main. Along with main, the keywords public and static will also be explained later.

- public: anyone can access it
- static: method can be run without creating an instance of the class containing the main method
- void: method doesn't return any value
- main: the name of the method
